The file newfile.tex contains a LaTeX template for PRL.

To simplify starting new PRL LaTeX directories, the steps are:

1. Download the zip archive from the GitHub superficial repository. You can find a button to download this zip file on lower right corner of the repository page,
2. unzip the downloade file, probably named superficial-master.zip, and
3. rename the directory superficial-master to prl.

That's it! Wish you a pleasant paper writing process.
