PRL Template
============

The file newfile.tex contains a LaTeX template for PRL.

To simplify starting new PRL LaTeX directories, the steps are:

- Download the zip archive from the GitHub superficial repository. You can find a button to download this zip file on lower right corner of the repository page,
- unzip the downloade file, probably named superficial-master.zip, and
- rename the directory superficial-master to prl.

That's it! Wish you very productive writing.
